- 🔄 **Service workers** from other sites
- 💾 **Browser cache** conflicts

---

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST THE FIX

### **1. Verify Error is Gone:**
1. Open your browser's **Developer Console** (F12)
2. Navigate to your cabinet business system pages
3. Look for the **green success messages** instead of red errors:
   - `✅ Client Proposal Phase 3 initialized successfully`
   - `✅ Configuration applied: Foundry Cabinets Co`
   - `📊 Event tracked: page_view`

### **2. Test with Extensions:**
1. **Keep all extensions enabled** - they won't break your system anymore
2. **Try different configurations** - switching should work smoothly
3. **Test CRM tracking** - lead scores should update properly
4. **Check mobile performance** - everything should work perfectly

### **3. Extension Conflict Testing:**
```javascript
// You can test if extensions are interfering:
console.log('Extension conflict test:', {
    localStorage: typeof localStorage !== 'undefined',
    addEventListener: typeof addEventListener !== 'undefined',
    configManager: typeof window.configManager !== 'undefined'
});
```
